                          The 19th International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP 2015)<br>
                          October 24 - 25, 2015, Suzhou, China<br>
                          <br>
                          The International Conference on Asian Language Processing (IALP) is a series of conferences with unique focus on Asian Language Processing. The conference aims to advance the science and technology of all the aspects of Asian Language Processing by providing a forum for researchers in the different fields of language study all over the world to meet. The first meeting of the series was held in Singapore in 1986 and was called the "International Conference on Chinese Computing (ICCC)" then. This meeting initiated the study of Chinese and oriental languages processing in Singapore and resulted in the formation of COLIPS in Singapore in 1988, as well as the publication of the journal "Communications of COLIPS" in 1991, which is known as "International Journal on Asian Language Processing" today.<br>
                          <br>
                          Over the years, IALP has developed into one of important annual events on natural language processing in Asia. IALP 2008 was held in Chiang Mai University, Thailand. IALP 2009 was held in Singapore and was co-organized by COLIPS and IEEE Singapore Computer Chapter. IALP 2010 was held in Harbin and was co-organized by COLIPS and IEEE Singapore Computer Chapter, Chinese Information Processing Society of China and Heilongjiang Institute of Technology (HIT). IALP 2011 was held in Penang, Malaysia and jointly organized by COLIPS, IEEE Singapore Computer Chapter, and Universiti Sains Malaysia. IALP 2012 was held in Hanoi, Vietnam and was co-organized by COLIPS and Hanoi University of Science and Technology (and MICA Institute). IALP 2013 was held in Urumqi, China and jointly organized by Xinjiang Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology and COLIPS. IALP 2014 was held in Kuching, Malaysia and jointly organized by the Institute of Social Informatics and Technological Innovations (ISITI) and Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS), IEEE Singapore Computer Chapter, and COLIPS. The proceedings of past IALP conferences were published by IEEE-CPS (Conference Publication Services). This year, we will continue to work with IEEE to publish the conference proceedings, which will be published and indexed by the IEEE Xplore digital library. High quality research papers will be selected and recommended to publish in ACM/IEEE Transactions. <br>
                          <br>
                          The International Conference on Asian Language Processing 2015 (IALP 2015) will be jointly organized by Soochow University, China and COLIPS. The conference will be held at Suzhou, China on the October 24 - 25, 2015. The city's canals, stone bridges, pagodas, and meticulously designed gardens have contributed to its status as one of the top tourist attractions in China. The classical gardens in Suzhou were added to the list of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1997 and 2000. Suzhou is often dubbed the "Venice of the East" or "Venice of China". <br>

                          <p class="index_title">Paper Submission</p>
                          Submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, relevance to the conference, and interest to the attendees. Each submission will be reviewed by three program committee members. Accepted papers will be presented in one of the oral sessions or poster sessions as determined by the program committee.<br>
                          <br>
                          As the reviewing will be blind, manuscripts must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Authors should ensure that their identities are not revealed in any way in the paper. Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...".<br>
                          <br>
                          All submissions must be electronic and in Portable Document Format (PDF) only. Paper submissions should follow the IEEE Proceedings' two-column format without exceeding four (4) pages including references. We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word style files according to IEEE Proceedings' format. Submissions must conform to the official style guidelines.<br>
                          <br>
                          The official language of the conference is English. Papers submitted should be written in English. <br>

                          IALP 2015 allows authors to submit manuscripts to leading NLP international conferences (e.g., EMNLP 2015) at the same time if the conferences have established similar multiple-submission policies. Papers that have been or will be submitted to other conferences must indicate this at the submission time. Authors of papers accepted for presentation in IALP 2015 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline (i.e., Sep 1, 2015) as to whether the paper will be presented at IALP 2015. Once confirmed, the paper must be withdrawn from other venues. We will not accept papers that are identical or overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. <br>
